# Investment Banking & Asset Manager

The following project contains several templates:

- Asset
- Portfolio
- Order
- Trade
- Investment

## Description of the project

The main idea of this project is to replicate some tasks in the asset management world by a financial services company using real-world scenarios such as creating assets, orders, portfolios, manage investments, and even replicate a potential trading.

These types of companies run into some heavy rules and criteria to increase their portfolio value white carefully mitigate some risks.

What I've in mind is to create a Smart Contract app using DAML to reproduce those steps in an automated way.
